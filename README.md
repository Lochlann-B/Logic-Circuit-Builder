# Logic Circuit Creator
Website for designing and testing logic circuits.
Uses QM method for logic simplification.
When entering an expression into the simplifier, use **&** or **\*** for logical AND, and **|** or **+** for logical OR. Note that there is no order of operations (e.g. a&b+c is interpreted as a&(b+c)), so use brackets generously.

## Keyboard shortcuts
**D** - delete the current gate you are hovering over and all associated connections.
